# RSA Cryptosystem in Python

This project implements the RSA cryptosystem for educational purposes. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a public and private key pair. The program was developed in Python, focusing on the mathematical and computational aspects of the RSA algorithm.

## Features

- **Key Management**: Input and update public keys `(n, e)`.
- **Encryption**: Convert plaintext messages into cipher text using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Recover plaintext messages from cipher text using the private key.
- **Pre-Coding Table**: Utilizes a predefined table for mapping characters to numbers and vice versa.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luckandrey/RSA.git
   cd RSA
2. Install Dependencies: The program uses sympy for mathematical operations:

bash
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Program: Execute the Python script:
bash
Copiar código
python rsa.py

4. Follow the Menu:
Input your public key (n, e).
Choose an operation: Encrypt a message, decrypt a message, or update the keys.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
SymPy library
